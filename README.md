Supervised learning methods to due with the Mexico COVID19 dataset predicting COVID 19 infection 

# About dataset
This project uses a condensed version of an epidemiology dataset of positive and negative COVID 19 cases from Mexico. Mexico's General Directorate of Epidemiology, Secretariat of Health, which collected the data. The lab RT PCR testing results for COVID 19 cases in Mexico are included in this collection. The dataset initially had 41 features and had 263,007 records. However, for the sake of this assignment, the number of features is decreased to just 11, consisting of 10 input features and one binary RT PCR "result" (i.e., the label).
